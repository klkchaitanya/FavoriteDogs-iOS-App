FAVORITE DOGS APPThe main home screen of the application consists of a view with two tabs: ‘Dog Breeds’ and ‘Favorite Dogs’ 1) Dog Breeds View: This view calls the Dog API, gets the list of all dog breeds and displays them in a list in Table View. On selecting one of the dog breeds, app navigates to a screen which displays images of the dogs of selected breed. a. Breed Collection View: This view displays a list of images of the selected dog breed in a collection view. On selecting the image, the app adds the image to the persistence storage displaying an alert that image has been saved. All images in collection view have a place-holder and this view displays alert whenever there is a problem with internet connection. Same image cannot be added to persistence storage more than once.

On selecting an image, it is deleted from the persistence storage and displays an alert saying that image has been deleted. If no images are found in persistence storage, it displays a label that ‘No Images are found’ in collection view.Favorite dog app displays alerts when there is no internet connection and displays message in background, if internet connection is so slow.
